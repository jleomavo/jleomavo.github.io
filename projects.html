        <p class="gameText">
          In 'Night King vs Predator!', you have the ability to move your character while guessing where the opponent will be. The user is allowed to move to any of the three slots
          displayed on screen (A,S,D) and the A.I bot will be allowed to move to their designated three slots (J,K,L). Once a user chooses where to move, they will guess where the AI
          will move to. The user/A.I earns 100 points every time they guess correctly. The user will lose 50 points every time the A.I bot guesses their move correctly and vice versa. 
        </p>
        <p class="gameText">
          Inspiration for this game came from the art of strafing. When I was competing competitively in Gears of War and Gears of War 2, strafing was the dominant 
          form of outplaying someone in a gnasher (shotgun) fight. Strafing with a controller is moving your analog (for player movement) left or right in a pattern. The art of strafing in Gears of War
          and other shooters is to strafe away from your opponents reticle while lining up your opponent in your reticle. People have certain tendencies and patterns which allowed 
          proficient strafing players to excel in gun fights.
